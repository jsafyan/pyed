# pyed

pyed is a python package to compute trajectories of evolutionary dynamics
on Riemannian geometries and with momentum.

## Repository history
This repository was originally named metric-incentive-dynamics and located at
https://github.com/marcharper/metric-incentive-dynamics
containing code to compute plots for a publication. See the [archived readme](archive/README.md)
for more information. The code was extended to support momentum and made into an installable
python package in the current repository.
